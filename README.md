Project Objective: Analysis of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and Its Expansion Opportunities
Introduction
The goal of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) and explore potential expansion opportunities. To accomplish this, we have analyzed a dataset containing information about key MCU films. The dataset, named mcu_box_office.csv, comprises 27 observations, each with ten properties. We used various data analysis methods and tools, including Excel, Python, and SAS, to extract insights and create meaningful visualizations.

Excel Analysis
In Excel, we performed the following tasks:

Calculated a series of indicators.
Created various types of charts.
Conducted regression analysis.
Utilized matrix functions, financial functions, logical functions, statistical functions, and user-defined functions.
Employed macros, Pivot Tables, Goal Seek, Scenarios, Solver, Subtotals, and more.
Python Data Analysis
In Python, we applied multiple data analysis techniques, including:

Using lists and dictionaries, including their specific methods.
Working with sets and tuples, including their specific methods.
Defining and calling functions.
Employing conditional structures.
Using iterative structures.
Importing CSV or JSON files using the Pandas library.
Accessing data with loc and iloc.
Data manipulation with Pandas, including handling missing values, column and row deletion, statistical processing, grouping, aggregation, data merging, and visualization with Matplotlib.
Utilizing the scikit-learn package for clustering and logistic regression.
SAS Analysis
In SAS, we accomplished the following tasks using SAS Enterprise Guide:

Imported non-SAS files.
Conducted queries and joins.
Utilized parameters.
Generated reports and graphics.
Performed statistical analysis.
Created user-defined formats.
Generated composite documents.
Utilized user-defined styles.
This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the MCU and its potential for expansion. The use of various tools and techniques allowed us to approach the data from different angles and derive meaningful conclusions.
